You are not expected to be a [Github Master](https://twitter.com/henryhoffman/status/694184106440200192) right out of the gate - experience comes with time. If this is your first time joining, go to [here](https://github.com/SubwayMan/Hamber-Programming-Club/blob/main/info/howtojoin.md) for your first steps. Sample code will be provided in direct link format to lessen the headache of "Where is the code?"
